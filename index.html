My Report on Garden Snails
</h1>
<h2>
From : Mentalfloss.com

<p>
One researcher argues that the myth of Cupid’s arrow might come from the mating rituals of Helix aspersa, a garden snail. Some of these snails shoot “love darts” at the object of their affections, containing mucus that increases the chances of their sperm surviving (snails are hermaphrodites, and both individuals receive sperm during mating). However, in earlier times, people believed that these snot rockets were gifts of calcium or were an aphrodisiac, and McGill University’s Ron Chase argues that this might the inspiration behind Cupid’s desire-inducing quiver.
